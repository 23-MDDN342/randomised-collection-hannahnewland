## 2024 MDDN342 Assignment 2: Randomised Collections

My initial idea is a variety of different fruits that have interchanging facial features. I want them to look annoying-orange-esque, maybe encorporating real images of human features or maybe just drawing them on javascript. 

I started by creating the apple in the editor, playing around with the eyes and mouth positioning. The apple has three eye values, where it has between 1-3 eyes. I then made its mouth, which will go on to be one of a few mouth options for the fruit.

I then moved onto the grapes. I initally wanted to do a banana, but after a lot of scribbling in my sketchbook trying to work out the best way to draw an accurately shaped banana using vertex points, I decided it would be less time consuming to do something a bit simpler, so I chose grapes. I wanted them all to be different colours, so I made an array of purples and pinks and used push and pop to make each ellipse a random colour from the array. 

While working on the grapes, I decided that the fruit reminded me of the dancing fruit baby sensory videos (like this one: https://youtu.be/b65MoVwANq4?si=R4O-3wTCvL4QHD9D), and I wanted the background to be black to mimic those videos.

The grapes, like the apple, have 1-3 eye options. The intial eyes I made for the grapes are different from the apple's, and they will become an option for all fruit. The grapes have a simpler initial mouth, just a curve with a black stroke. 

The grapes became a bit of a test rabbit for noses before I moved on to the pear. I realised when I went to add the noses to the apple that they just wouldn't work because I had built the apple first without factoring in space for the noses. I  decided to leave the apple without noses because I prefer how it looks without, and didn't want to sacrifice what I already thought looked good. 

Because of this, when I made the pear I made sure to paste the nose functions in first so I knew they would fit around the eyes. The pear is different from the apple and grapes as it only has 1 or 2 eyes. I felt as if 3 eyes would take up a lot of space in the shape, and I preferred the look of 2. 

Working on the pear's mouth is where I began to add the features from each fruit to one another. Once I had added all the eye variations to the apple, I was able to basically just copy and paste them between fruit, with some variations with positioning.
